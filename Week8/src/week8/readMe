Check the bezier spline example for the assignment.
Booking timeslots - just in the tutorial.
VBOs

1. TextureExample1.java - 
try to do 2 instead of 1 to show the different effects and modulate.
try to do texture coordinates of the triangle.

3. Do our own cylinder

2. TexturesLightingExample.java - 
show lighting modulate and secular searate
show bad coords in the shere and seems etc.

4. Do our own sphere
